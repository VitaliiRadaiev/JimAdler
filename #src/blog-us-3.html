                        According to Brainline.org, approximately 1.7 million Americans suffer from traumatic brain injuries (TBI) each year. One fact that can make any parent cringe is that one of the groups most likely to get a TBI is children younger than 4 years old. With falls being the most common type of personal injury that causes a TBI, it is not a surprise that children are most at risk
                    <p>
                        Parents and other adults who need help in understanding their rights after a TBI should talk to a qualified Houston brain injury lawyer at Jim Adler & Associates.

                            When you look at a case review of each type of brain injury lawsuit that is filed in the United States, one concerning fact that stands out is that the causes of approximately 21 percent of TBIs are unknown. Some of this is because children often cannot clearly express what happened to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the more dominant reason is that many TBI accidents have no witnesses, and that makes it difficult for even the best Houston brain injury lawyer to prove their case. But at Jim Adler & Associates, we believe that getting restitution for a TBI victim is extremely important, and that is why our brain injury lawyers work hard for our clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A big reason for hiring a good brain injury attorney is because insurance companies tend to make filing claims for TBI accidents complicated. The last thing you or your loved one needs when facing the results of a serious TBI is to have to deal with complicated forms and procedures. Our legal team will get the facts from you and then do our best to put together a case that will get you the settlement you need to get your life back on track.

                    Types of Brain Injuries
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the state of Texas and around the country, there are several types of TBIs that can occur, and it is important to know the difference between each one. When your brain injury attorney starts to put together your lawsuit, it is important to know what type of TBI has occurred so that the proper terms can be used and the right accusations toward the negligent parties can be made.
                </p>
                <div class="col-2">
                    <p>
                        Concussions. A concussion is one of the more recognizable types of TBIs, but it is not the only type. According to the Brain Injury Alliance of Utah, a concussion occurs either as a result of a direct blow to the head or when the head violently shakes. If you are in a car accident and your head violently moves back and forth, for instance, then that can cause a concussion despite the fact that you had no direct blow to the head.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Penetration. A brain penetration is a situation that brain injury lawyers also see on a regular basis. This is when the skull and brain are penetrated by a knife, a bullet, or any other type of object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contusion. A contusion is how doctors refer to bleeding on the brain. This usually occurs due to a direct blow to the head, and it is a situation that often needs to be resolved through surgery. A coup-contrecoup is a contusion that occurs on both sides of the brain. It happens when there is a contusion at the point of impact and then the brain shifts after impact and receives another contusion as it hits the skull on the other side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diffuse Axonal. This is a less common TBI, but it can be deadly to young victims. A diffuse axonal injury occurs when the brain is damaged due to being vigorously shaken. When this happens to an infant, it is also referred to as “shaken baby syndrome.”
