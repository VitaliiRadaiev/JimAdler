                    Channelview Law Office Locations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Houston we work from two offices: the law firm’s home office on West Loop 610 in the
                    Uptown/Galleria area, and its Channelview office just off Interstate 10 (I-10) on the city’s east
                    side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There you’ll find the help you need not only for car accident cases, but also injuries involving the
                    workplace. The Adler law firm also helps Americans needing Social Security disability payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for traffic accidents, many involve 18-wheelers, also called big rigs, semi trucks, tractor
                    trailers or diesel trucks. Such 18-wheeler accidents can be catastrophic, often severely injuring if
                    not killing the occupants of far smaller cars.

                        Though many state traffic laws are the same from city to city, each city also has its own laws
                        governing traffic, such as varied speed limits depending on the thoroughfare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, Houston has no law yet to ban using cellphones while driving, or even texting
                        while driving. But some suburbs and nearby cities ban texting while driving, including Bellaire,
                        West University Place, Missouri City, Conroe and Galveston.

                        Houston stands out in many other ways, though. Home to many oil companies and refineries, it is
                        the Energy Capital of the World. It’s also home to the Johnson Space Center and NASA’s Mission
                        Control, as well as the Texas Medical Center — the world’s largest — and Port of Houston, the
                        nation’s busiest in terms of foreign tonnage and second-busiest overall.

                <p>
                    The nation’s Space City, Houston always is pushing to the future, including its growth. It’s now the most ethnically diverse city in America, offering world-class restaurants and art venues, as well as major league sports in football, baseball, basketball and soccer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though some older landmarks have fallen, others remain, including — for the time being — the world’s first domed stadium, the Astrodome. And in honor of its hometown president, “Bush 41,” Houston’s biggest airport (exceeding Hobby Airport) is named George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
