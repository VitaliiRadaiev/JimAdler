                    What Is a Spinal Cord Injury?

                        Before you start interviewing spinal cord injury lawyers, it is important to know what constitutes a spinal cord injury. A spinal cord injury is any sort of trauma that prevents the bundle of nerves that make up the spinal cord from being able to operate properly. It is most commonly some sort of blow to the back, and its degree of devastation depends on the damage that is done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an attorney decides to do a case review for your spinal cord injury, there are two immediate conditions the legal expert looks for. Paralysis is when the nerves are completely blocked at a certain point, preventing any signals from reaching certain parts of the body. The result is an inability to move extremities or even entire sections of the body, such as any area below the waist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An incomplete spinal injury results in some loss of sensation and some loss of movement, but the damage is not quite as devastating as paralysis. In the legal world, the size of your lawsuit may depend on whether you have a complete or partial blockage of the nerves, and the success of your claim depends on how well your Houston spinal cord injury lawyer presents your case.

                        According to a study done at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, approximately 12,000 people per year survive accidents with some form of spinal cord injury. The most common type of injury that causes spinal cord damage is a car accident, and the average age of spinal cord injury victims is 41 years old. Spinal cord injuries can also occur during sporting events, in violent altercations, and in falls off of ladders or from heights.

                    <p>
                        Another shocking fact about spinal cord injuries is that approximately 80 percent of these injuries happen to males between the ages of 16 and 30. Establishing negligence in a spinal cord injury case can be difficult because the injuries are often due to the actions of multiple people. But establishing negligence is critical in getting the victim the compensation they need to get their
