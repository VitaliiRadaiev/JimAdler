                        When people think of the state of Texas, they usually think of wide open plains and the Gulf of Mexico. But did you know that there are more than 150 freshwater lakes in Texas, and a vast majority of those lakes are open to the public?

                    <p>
                        While fishing is a popular pastime in Texas, boating is also something many people throughout the state enjoy. No one wants to think about boat accidents, but they do happen and they can be dangerous. In order to avoid boating accidents, you need to educate yourself on good habits for safe boating.

                    The Facts About Boating Accidents in Texas

                    <p>
                        When you read statistics on boat accidents from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, you can see that the number of boating accidents and fatalities has been steadily dropping since 2010. But it is also easy to see that hundreds of people are arrested each year for boating while intoxicated. As with drivers on the road, boating enthusiasts can become dangerous to those around them when they decide to drink and drive.

                    <p>
                        When you are involved in a boating accident with an intoxicated driver, a good boat accident lawyer can make sure that the intoxicated driver pays the price for their negligence, especially if that negligence resulted in serious injuries to you or someone else on the boat.

                    Staying Safe on the Water

                        You never think about having to hire a boat accident attorney, but things can change quickly on the water. As any legal professional will tell you, sometimes you are not in control of the things that affect you. But you can reduce your chances of serious injuries while out on the open water by following some basic safety tips that any boat accident attorney would recommend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before you head out for the day on your boat, always check the weather reports to see if any storms are coming in. If you and your passengers get caught in a storm that was announced on the radio and someone gets hurt, it could be you who faces a lawsuit for personal injury damages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should always have a plan for your trip, and you should let someone on shore know where and when you are going. Give a friend or family member a list of everyone on your boat along with their personal information so that a proper alert can be given to authorities if you do not return by the designated time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being careful with your preparations can help to protect you from any claim should something go wrong.
