                    According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the US in 2019, there were 2,814,000 total recordable cases of non-fatal injuries and illnesses in private industry. According to the Texas Department of Insurance, Texas remains below the national average for non-fatal workplace injury and illness reporting. In 2019 nationally, there were 2.8 reported accidents and/or illnesses per 100 workers and in Texas there were 2.1 per 100 workers. But it’s likely those numbers are actually higher. It’s common for workers not to report injuries for fear of retaliation by their employer.

                    Life has an element of danger to it and so do the jobs we do during the course of our lives. That sometimes leads us to minimize our workplace related illnesses and injuries. But workers face greater risks when employers don’t have in place and follow safety protocols.

                As for occupations, statewide, the highest rate of fatalities per occupation is for driver/sales workers and truck drivers, which accounted for 47% of the state’s total fatal injury count. And things are getting worse for Texans – many occupations saw increases in the number of fatal incidents from 2018 to 2019. Construction and extraction had the largest increase in number of incidents and accounted for 22%. Building, grounds cleaning and maintenance had the largest percent increase from 2018 to 2019, a 188% increase. Transportation and material moving also increased and accounted for 33% of all fatal work injuries statewide. In 2019, in the private and public sector, there were 608 fatal occupational (work-related) injuries in Texas, a 25% increase from 2018.

                If you or a loved one becomes ill, injured or has died because of workplace related activities, call a personal injury lawyer.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, employers retaliate often, which is why workers can hesitate to make a claim or inform a superior at their workplace. Workers in Texas might be able to receive compensation if they are injured or made ill as a result of a company’s failure to abide by certain safety measures, regardless of whether they are eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. That’s because in Texas employers are not required to have workers’ compensation coverage and that leaves them open to lawsuits from injured or ill employees or former employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if your employer does have workers’ compensation insurance, then you should absolutely file a claim if you were hurt or got sick on the job. Employers often end up firing injured or ill employees, anyway, regardless of whether they filed the claim. Undocumented injured workers are also protected under Texas’ workers’ compensation law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t try to manage your work-related accident or illness alone. If you or a loved one have been injured on the job in the Houston area you should consult with an experienced personal injury lawyer to discuss your legal options and fight for a fair settlement for your on-the-job injury or illness.
