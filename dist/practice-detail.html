                    There’s no sugarcoating it: Houston has the deadliest roads and drivers in the country. If you’re a
                    Houstonian that has to get behind the wheel everyday, you know how dangerous it can be. From trucks
                    ramming into the back of cars at breakneck speeds, pedestrians being run over, and motorcyclists
                    being struck on their bikes, our car accident lawyers have seen it all when it comes to some of the
                    deadliest cases in Houston. </div>

                        What should I do right after a car accident?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="info-block__text text-content">
                        <p>
                            There are several steps to take after a car accident to protect yourself and Texas has laws
                            surrounding this. Let’s take a look at step by step instructions on what to do after a car
                            accident.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ensure that you’re okay and anyone in the vehicle with you are okay. Also check on
                                anyone else involved in the wreck to see if they’re okay. Then, if you’re able, move as
                                far away from oncoming traffic as quickly as you can. The accident site itself will
                                increase the odds of another accident. Keep yourself safe.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Call 911 if there seems to be an emergency situation. If you still have your cell phone
                                on you, call 911. If you don’t have a cell phone, see if anyone else has one. If you’re
                                near other buildings where people are, ask them to call 911. Find a way to call 911.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If there isn’t a direct emergency after the accident, call the local police department
                                to report the accident.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the police arrive, and they see the need for you to sign a traffic citation, you
                                should sign it. This does not mean that you’re guilty of anything.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always get the police officers’ names and division. This is important information that
                                you’ll have to add to your personal file for documentation purposes.
                            </li>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you’ve suffered due to a car accident, it is completely normal to take care of your health first.
                    For many people, hiring a car accident lawyer to start the legal process sounds stressful. But keep
                    in mind, you don’t have an unlimited amount of time to file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every state’s statute of limitations surrounding car accident cases is different. So, what does
                    “statute of limitations” mean? It means that there is a limit on the amount of time you have to file
                    a lawsuit. In the cases of personal injury and claims surrounding property damage, you have two
                    years to file a petition with the courts in Texas (there are some exceptions to this). Two years is
                    not an unlimited amount of time so don’t procrastinate. The sooner you take action, the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind that contacting a lawyer should NOT add stress. An attorney’s goal is to relieve the
                    stress of your legal claim and handle the process entirely ourselves.

                    Why should I hire a Houston car accident lawyer?
                </h3>
                <div class="col-2">
                    <p>
                        Not every car accident case needs a lawyer. Although it is perfectly fine to file a personal
                        injury claim against an insurance company by yourself, this route may only be suitable if you’ve
                        suffered minor injuries in your car accident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for catastrophic and serious car accidents that result in severe injuries and expensive
                        medical bills, you should hire a qualified car accident lawyer that will be able to help you
                        fight the insurance companies. Your car accident lawyer will have knowledge of the applicable
                        laws surrounding your case and will be there to help you with all of the legal filings. They
                        will represent you throughout the life cycle of your case and will act on your behalf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many people that are uncomfortable with hiring a lawyer for matters like car wrecks
                        and injuries. They often believe that it further complicates the problem or is completely
                        unaffordable. This lack of understanding usually causes more problems in the long run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s the thing: many people don’t realize how complicated car accident claims can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Insurance companies proclaim to have your best interest at heart, but in reality, their job is
                        to do the least amount for you as possible. In addition to this, the more severe the accident
                        was, the higher the likelihood you’re going to get taken advantage of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People don’t realize the importance of protection needed in cases that involve serious car
                        accidents. You can never trust the other party to do right by you. For example, if a car pulled
                        out in front of you, hit you and then a passenger in that car passed away as a result, you
                        cannot trust that they won’t accuse you of the difficult situation. Protection means everything
                        and a car accident lawyer is a necessity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aren’t saying that you don’t have the right to deal with your own claim. There are many
                        people out there that prefer to handle their matters completely on their own. But it isn’t
                        always wise. We have encountered countless situations in which those that were injured in car
                        accidents were short-changed by insurance companies. Don’t let that person be you! With the
                        right attorney, you can claim what is rightfully yours and without the added stress of dealing
                        with the insurance companies.

                        A qualified lawyer can help you fight the insurance companies. If you try to do it on your own,
                        it will usually spell disaster. Insurance companies earn their money by ensuring that you
                        receive as little as possible from the car accident. If you sustained serious injuries from the
                        accident, you absolutely cannot rely on the insurance company to honor you. It’s crucial for you
                        to reach out to a car accident lawyer so that you may have the proper guidance in dealing with
                        the insurance company and all other parties involved.

                        A car accident lawyer can also help you lower your medical bills. An average emergency room
                        visit can cost in upwards of $20,000 and hospital stays and surgeries can cost several thousand
                        dollars. Even physical therapy can be expensive!

                    Important questions to ask after a car accident
                </h3>
                <div class="questions-block__text text-content">
                    After a car accident, there’s often a lot of confusion as to what you should do. We stated earlier what to do immediately after the accident. What about in the days afterward? If you’re struggling with what you should do in terms of dealing with only the insurance company or hiring a car accident attorney, ask yourself these important questions.

									The insurance company was being extremely difficult and vague with me when I tried to file the car accident claim, downplaying the damage to my vehicle and the injuries to me. I told them to talk to my lawyer! I called Jim Adler and they gave me more insight and help than I thought was possible. They did a great job!

                        Yes, you could. However, it’s highly recommended NOT to do so as insurance companies are notorious for offering extremely low settlements and even denying claims.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        People who have never studied the law are not prepared to fight against an insurance company. Simply researching laws in Texas won’t instantly make you a schooled person of the law. The court will expect you to know every bit as much as a lawyer would know and they will hold you accountable for your case. And the insurance companies know this is where they can take advantage of you.
