                            Yes! We are currently still open for business and are actively accepting new clients as well as working on existing cases. In order to comply with CDC and government recommendations and rules, we are actively practicing social distancing. As a result, many members of our staff are working from home.

                            Additionally, in order to protect both our team members still working in the office as well as clients, we’re currently opening the office to clients on an appointment basis only. We are also encouraging phone calls with clients as much as possible, to avoid unnecessary in-person interactions.
