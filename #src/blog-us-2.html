                        The American Burn Association estimates that 486,000 people will be injured in burn accidents in
                        2016. Of those 486,000 victims, 40,000 will be hospitalized and 3,275 will die from their
                        injuries.

                        When you or someone you love has suffered a personal injury due to fire, you will want to
                        consider hiring a Houston burn injury lawyer. You cannot allow someone’s negligence to cause you
                        injury without getting the kind of legal help that will get you the compensation you deserve.

                        In Texas, where industrial accidents occur on a regular basis, you need to be aware of what
                        types of burns you could be exposed to and what type of burn injury attorney you will need to
                        watch over you.

                    <p>
                        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that fires and drowning were the two
                        most common types of accidents suffered by children in the United States four years old and
                        younger from 2000 to 2006. While many of these accidents occur in public places, many are due to
                        residential issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are visiting a home and your child gets burned, then you should not hesitate to seek out
                        professional medical and legal assistance. Your child’s injuries could require years of
                        rehabilitation, and a good attorney can make sure that you get the funds you need to have your
                        child treated for as long as necessary.

                <h3>
                    There Are Many Different Types of Fires
                </h3>

                    <p>
                        Thermal: Thermal fires include flash fires, scalds, contact, and flame. This is the type of fire
                        most people are familiar with, and these are the types of fires that most commonly affect people
                        around the country. Flash fires can occur when fire is contained in an area and then suddenly
                        released, such as fire behind a door in a burning building. Scalds occur when a hot liquid of
                        any type makes contact with the skin. Contact fire injuries are the burns you get from touching
                        a hot pan on the stove or when you lean up against a pipe you did not know was hot. Flame fires
                        are the most common and can occur under any circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chemical: Chemical fires occur most commonly in industrial or research settings. In some cases,
                        chemical burns can be extremely destructive because of their natural reactions to elements found
                        in human skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Radiological: Radiological fires are most common in research and industrial settings, but they
                        can also occur in a medical facility with malfunctioning equipment. Radiological burns often
                        need to be treated for a long period of time before they are considered safe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Electrical: Electrical burns occur when someone gets caught in a running current or grabs onto
                        two wires and helps to complete a current. Electrical burns can often do more internal than
                        external damage, which makes them difficult to treat.
